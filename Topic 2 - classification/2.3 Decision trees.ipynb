The tutorial contains instructions on how to use decision trees for both classification and regression in Python. \n",

    "Using what you learnt in the scikit-learn decision tree tutorial, use decision trees for classification on the iris dataset, and for regression on the diabetes dataset (both included in ```sklearn.datasets```). Your code should print the accuracy and the confusion matrix for the classification problem, and mean squared error for the regression. Try comparing the results for different maximum tree depths. \n",
